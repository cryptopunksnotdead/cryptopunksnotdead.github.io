### Blockchain Analytics Script by 0xmunger - How Many Matt & John's® Punks Are Lost Forever? 

[**0xmunger**](https://github.com/0xmunger) has put together a (python) script 
that queries  (ethereum) blockchain services to find out how many of the 10,000  
Matt & John's® Punks are lost forever - by checking punks that have been in wallets without
any activity for years.  See [**0xmunger/lost-punks »**](https://github.com/0xmunger/lost-punks)

> Roughly 192, or 2% of CryptoPunks are lost. "Lost" is defined as a wallet 
> or related wallet having no transactions for 4 years.
>
> Interestingly, 155 of the 192 are concentrated in two wallets: 
> 0x717 which has 89 punks and 0x776 which has 66 punks.
