Hello,

  For a week now I follow the 24px story that started some weeks before on August 2nd with the drop (and sale) of the first art collection by an anonymous dev called 24px.

 24px dropped two pixel collections (on the open sea market):

- [**24px pixel cats**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/awesome-24px/blob/master/collection/coolcats.png) (inspired by cool cats) on August 2nd and
- [**24px pixel apes**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/awesome-24px/blob/master/collection/boredapes.png) (inspired by bored ape [yacht club]) - really in the 28x28px format ;-) - on August 24th.

See [**24px.art**](https://24px.art) for more.

  What's your take on the 24px story and/or pixel art collections?
  Your comments are welcome. Let's learn and study together.

PS:  Yes, there's a 24px reddit channel started on August 14th, see **r/24px**

What's your take? It's all about the price and getting-rich-quick, isn't it greater fools?
