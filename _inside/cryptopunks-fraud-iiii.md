I am not a lawyer but let's get real. Yes, in a free world you can of course create and sell your own punks.

About the  originals by LarvaLabs  - the first question is are they really original?  See the [**Blockheads (Anno 2013)**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/cryptopunks/tree/master/blockheads) and I am sure there are many more.

I'd say you cannot copyright a trivial 24x24 pixel image - there might be a point about the complete collection (like you can copyright a complete database but not individual facts).

Anyways, the irony is of course the name, that is, CryptoPunks.

The punk ethos is that you do-it-yourself and you don't care what others think (oh, that looks so cheap and so on).  And crypto - of course - is by definition a law-less "decentralised" fraudster paradise where anything goes. And yes, selling 24x24 pixel images by itself is a fraud and shame on the LarvaLabs fraudsters¹ for not stopping the madness but raking in the millions $$$ from greater fools.

¹: Please remember - a blockchain token - is nothing special - it is just a signed database entry. Yes, the emperor has no clothes. See [**Come See My Collection**](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/bitcoin/2021-04-02-come-see-my-collection.html)  from a more honest computer scientist  (shame on Matt Hall and John Watkinson both have computer science university degrees - so they for sure know what they are doing and how a database works).
