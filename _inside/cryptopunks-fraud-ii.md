Hello,

  As always Trolly McTrollface - the former [Bitcon Maxi Club critique](https://bitsblocks.github.io/bitcoin-maximalist) - and now [famous Art market connoisseur](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoPunksDev/comments/pgmwzb/former_bitcoin_maxi_club_critic_trolly/) is on to something:

> Just bought all my art tokens for 10% more than what
> I paid for them to myself last week.
> As a result my portfolio of pixel art is going up nicely in value.
> Expecting a Forbes piece about my outstanding pixel art

  Did you know? That you can 1) open-up and use as many free Ethereum accounts as you like (more than atoms exist in the universe)  and 2) sell to yourself with the CryptoPunksMarket contract for free  (you pay only the Ethereum "gas" transaction fee) from one of your many accounts to another.

  Anyone has any insight how much of the market is self-dealing to pump up the price and pull-in greater fools to scam? What's your take?
