Hello,

   So far I got asked here on crypto punk's not dead
  about videos (how to do an art token fraud in five minute or such) but never about books about the history or money (and fraud).

   Anyways, let's bring on David Gerard - a crypto / blockchain historian and writer - to help us out:

> Dan Davies' Lying for Money is another of those books
> I recommend to everyone, all the time. Only Chapter 2, on darknet markets, is directly about crypto - but the rest of the bookâ€™s totally about crypto. Also, you need both editions.
>
> [...]
>
> Davies has a Golden Rule for detecting fraud:
>
>> Anything which is growing unusually quickly needs to be
>> checked out, and it needs to be checked out in a way that it
>> hasn't been checked before. Nearly all of the frauds in this
>> book could have been stopped a lot earlier if people had been
>> a bit more cynical about growth.

 Anyways comments and questions welcome. What crypto (or history of money) books do you recommend or read?
