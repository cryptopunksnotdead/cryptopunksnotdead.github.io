Hello,

   To see how absurd the crypto punks news coverage¹ (and gambling community) is - let's have a looksie what we have learned about the revolutionary [**CryptoPunksData contract**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.contracts#punksdata----cryptopunksdata-update--add-on--service) (uploaded and gone live on August 18th) about three weeks ago.

The CryptoPunks founders start off with a teaser in the code commentary inside the contract:

> This contract holds the image and attribute data for the Cryptopunks on-chain.
> The Cryptopunk images are available as raw RGBA pixels, or in SVG format.
> The punk attributes are available as a comma-separated list.
> Included in the attribute list is the head type (various color male and female heads,
> plus the rare zombie, ape, and alien types).

  First let's search the internets with the keywords [**cryptopunksdata contract**](https://www.google.com/search?q=cryptopunksdata+contract)  and - surprise, surprise - we end-up right back here as the top search result.   A billion dollar asset and the founders published the secret formula as an open book and we get not a single analysis or posting. Nada. Nothing. Zero.

   What am I missing?  If you find anything, please share and comment. Let's learn and study together.

¹: On-chain? Off-chain? Whatever. It's all about the price and numbers go up, isn't it greater fools?
