Hello,

  As a public service announcement allow me to restate what might get lost in the programming minutiae:

  Yes, CryptoPunks is a con-artist financial fraud. The Emperor has no clothes. Let's start with what you "own" when you buy a CryptoPunk [token].

   The only thing that you "own" is the private 256-bit integer number that you create (for free) on your own computer and that you MUST keep secret, that is, your private key.

   From the 256-bit integer number (private key) you get a "free" public key and public Ethereum account  - the account gets derived (calculated) via Elliptic Curve Cryptography from the public key.

   Anyways, if you now buy a CryptoPunks token via the CryptoPunksMarket contract / service - all you get is an entry in a database that you are now a "certified" CryptoPunks owner and you get assigned an index number (between 0 and 9999).   That's it.

  There's nothing decentralized or trustless.  You have to trust the central issuer LarvaLabs that you own a picture / image of punk.

   And the fact is that LavraLabs actually tell you that you don't. To quote:

  And so on and so forth. What's your take?
