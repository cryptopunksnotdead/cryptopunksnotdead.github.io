What's your take? Is 10 000 the new 21 Million? Are art tokens the new true digital gold originals? Or the new comedy gold?

Whose your favorite art token critic / bullshiter that you follow to ape in to make big $$$?


**Update** The [**first edition of Trolly's newsletter**](https://trolly.substack.com/p/doggy-3362) is out!

What's your take on Doggy #3362? Is a mere $11,185 a steal?
