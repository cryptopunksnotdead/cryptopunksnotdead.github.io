Hello,

   the idea is to put together an all-in-one sprite sheet (image) with all archetypes and attributes for easy (re)use and with "standardized" numbers and names.

   Kind of like unicode for punks :-).  What's your take?

  How would you number the archetypes and attributes?  For now my thinking is to separate male and female and start with Male 1, Male 2, and so on and the mirror Female 1, Female 2, and so on and start with offset 100 with the hair attributes and so on.

   Still early.  I try to put together a protopage / type / sheet in the next days.

  Questions and comments welcome.
