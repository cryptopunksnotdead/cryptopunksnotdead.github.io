Hello,

   Inspired by [Blockheads - The Guide to 70 Boy Skins (Anno 2013)](https://forums.theblockheads.net/t/the-guide-to-boy-skins/6964)  I've put together an article titled [**Blockheads (Anno 2013) - Let's Build 8x8 Pixel Art Avatars from Scratch**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/cryptopunks/tree/master/blockheads).

  Yes, you can! Now generate your own 8x8 blockheads and use your own designs. Bonus for adding the missing beard building blocks / attributes.
