Hello,

   I've put together a little [**generate sample script**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/cryptopunks/blob/master/punksdata-contract/generate.rb) using the CryptoPunksData data / decoding machinery
that lets you run your own free decentralized autonomous punk generator contract /service (offline and offchain) in your own home.

   Yes, you can generate your own punks too - pass along the attributes by number / id or by name. Example:

``` ruby
punk = punks.generate( "Alien, Knitted Cap, Regular Shades" )
punk.zoom(4).save( "punk4x.png" )
```

Same as:

``` ruby
punk = punks.generate( 11, 22, 21 )
```

Questions and comments welcome.
