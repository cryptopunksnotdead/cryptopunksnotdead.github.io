Hello,

  I added a new sample collection to [/**punks.starter**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.starter) - the free pixel art collection quick starter package that lets you generate algorithmically your own curated (or randomized) collections.

  Let's welcome Collection №3 (a remix of №2 with a special visual effect) - The First One Hundred Pixel Art Punks - The Black & White (Pencil Drawing) Sketch Edition. Yes, you can. Generate your own editions of the first one hundred punks in the original Larva Labs series with a transformative visual special effect twist.

 Questions and comments welcome.
