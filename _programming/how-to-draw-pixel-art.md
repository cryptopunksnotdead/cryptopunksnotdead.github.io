Hello,

  I have put together a new pixel art getting started guide titled [**How to Draw Shiba Inu or Kawaii Dog - Handmade (24x24) Pixel Art**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/cryptopunks/tree/master/shibainu).

   Yes, you can.  Get inspired by watching pixel art videos on the internets and turn the paper version into ready-to-mint digital gold originals!

PS: For some ready to (re)use free punk designs in the "ascii" text pixel format, see [**punks.design**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.design).
