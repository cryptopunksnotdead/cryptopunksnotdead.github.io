Hello,

   In the last ["New Punk, Rocks! Series"](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoPunksDev/comments/papjex/new_punk_rocks_series_100_punk_rocks_in_original/) post  the "Punk, Rocks!" was trying to be a funny word play. Now the 24px Rocks website reads:

> 10 hand drawn punk rocks. When two historical giants meet...

Yes, to celebrate the historical meeting
